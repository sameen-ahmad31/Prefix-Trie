# Prefix Trie
I have developed a robust prefix trie data structure, known as ptrie, to support various operations efficiently. This trie serves as a lookup structure and plays a central role in our program. It features allocation and deallocation functions, along with two essential operations: ptrie_add and ptrie_autocomplete.

The ptrie_add operation enables the addition of strings into the prefix trie. By doing so, a path is established from the root of the trie to the added string, navigating through nodes representing increasingly larger prefixes. Each node keeps track of the number of times each string has been added, facilitating autocomplete operations later on. The ptrie_autocomplete operation allows us to request autocompletion for a given string based on the previously added strings. As we traverse the trie to find possible matches, the autocomplete feature considers the maximum count of a sub-trie, guiding us to the most frequently added string or sub-trie that matches the input prefix.

This simple and efficient prefix trie structure ensures fast lookup times with a cost of O(N), where N represents the length of the string. It efficiently handles string prefixes, allowing us to perform various operations seamlessly, thus making it a valuable component of our overall program. For more detailed information about the API and implementation, refer to ptrie.h.

To gain a better understanding of how the prefix trie works, consider the figure provided in the documentation. It walks through a sequence of ptrie_adds and offers examples of the ptrie_autocomplete output, demonstrating the trie's practical application and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
